# LINQ-Tutorial-for-Beginners-Lecture-Notes-and-Examples
After my little struggle to learn EF Core, I decided to improve my LINQ skills by learning and practicing from the basics.

All these notes and examples are taken from the video series of Nitish Kaushik's LINQ Tutorial for Beginners on YouTube.
Here is the link of the original series in English: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaFzfwmPR7_IZuwiT6nqcvNEhKl_Mg19A

I translated the whole lecture in Turkish and localized the examples. 
It was a great help to improve my English and polishing my LINQ skills.
